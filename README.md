- Discovered more sales were made online than offline
- Sub-suharan Africa made the most sales overall
- North America made the most sales
- The most sold item over the years is "Office Supplies"

## Final Conclusion
- Since the North America has the least sales, research should be done as to why they are low and more advertisement should be done
- The fruit section has been dooing bad lately, it is recommended that it be scraped off completely
- Alot of people prefer shopping online than offline, that should be utitilized. AThe store should invest in online ads.
